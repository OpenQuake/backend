# AzzurroFramwork

AzzurroFramwork is a PHP framework inspired by AngularJS and its dependency injection. I created this framework trying to emulate all the concepts introduced with AngularJS itself, so if you are familiar with them you will have less problems deveping mudularized PHP application using AzzurroFramework in the same way. I hope you like it :)

## Getting Started

Just download the lastest realease and extract it on the root of your web server.

### Installing

The framework is already app and running. You must create your application starting from app/app.php where it resides the definition of your main module.
